This is a public repo of usual scripts & training documents that I typically
used for my daily usage during Linux development.

The list of scripts added:
 1) bcross-compile-linux-check.sh
	: automate cross-compilation build. This script is still under
	  development

 2) poll_system.sh
	: An example implementation for Linux Basic 102 labwork question used
	  to monitor system usage: memory & interrupt.
